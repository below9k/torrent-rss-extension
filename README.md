Copy a magnet link for torrent (ie. `magnet:?xt=urn:btih:175ED6F7365FC59D7D4FB1EB3B65328781F33808&dn=horriblesubs+one+punch+man+06+720p+mkv&tr=http%3A%2F%2Fopen.nyaatorrents.info%3A6544%2Fannounce&tr=udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337`)

Select the extension in the top right - looks like a film strip.
